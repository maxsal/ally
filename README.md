`{ally}` üì¶ is a package comprised of many functions developed by R users over time that they've found useful, helpful, or, at worst, fun. We are currently compiling functions for inclusion. If you have thoughts, comments, ideas, suggestions, or interest in sharing a function for the package, feel free to contact me at [mmsalva@umich.edu](mailto:mmsalva@umich.edu) or üê¶ [@MaxSalTweets](twitter.com/MaxSalTweets)

## Installation üì•

``` r
# Only the development version of this package is available at this time

# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("maxsal/ally")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(ally)

## install and load libraries
libri(tidyverse, janitor, glue, maxsal/covid19india)
```

## Coming soon :movie_camera:

- :robot: Save ad-hoc function as R script
- :book: `dear_diary`: a family of functions for jotting down quick project updates/ideas
